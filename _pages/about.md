**Update**: I am currently at [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) with the Security Protocol Engineering group working on the [MSL Protocol](https://github.com/Netflix/msl).

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu) and work in the [Ethos Lab](https://github.com/Ethos-lab). I am advised by [Prof. Amir Rahmati](https://amir.rahmati.com).

My research focuses on addressing the critical challenges of systems and network security in emerging technologies, particularly in developing secure and privacy-centric solutions for mobile systems, including smartphones, wearables (such as AR/VR devices), and IoT or smart home ecosystems. As personal devices evolve with increasingly complex designs and continuous sensing capabilities, they introduce new security and privacy threats that can compromise user safety.

I investigate how developers create user-facing systems, analyzing potential security and privacy implications that may arise from obscure design practices and functional indirections. My goal is to develop practical designs that not only meet operational requirements for developers but also uphold robust security and privacy protections for end users.

I have been collaborating closely with [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com) focusing on [Samsung Knox](https://www.samsungknox.com/en) for enterprise solutions. Prior to my Ph.D. program, I spent several years with the [ArubaOS](https://www.arubanetworks.com/products/network-management-operations/arubaos/) Infrastructure team, at [HPE Aruba Networks](https://www.arubanetworks.com/company/about-us), where I enhanced their distributed shared memory infrastructure for large scale deployments. My contributions were recognized with multiple awards for high-impact work during my tenure.

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from [North Carolina State University](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/), where I was a graduate research student in the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) under the guidance of Professors [William Enck](https://enck.org) and [Brad Reaves](https://bradreaves.net/). My MS thesis proposed a novel network-based access control model tailored for smart home ecosystem, which can be accessed [here](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/items/8a983540-1425-4f53-abdb-38bed1806cd2).

**Research Funding** : I am fortunate to have my research supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Samsung Research America.

**Media Coverage** 
+ My research on security hardening of AR and IoT systems has been covered by the [Future Force Magazine - Vol. 9, 2023](https://www.onr.navy.mil/media/document/future-force-vol-9-no-1-2023).
+ My contributions towards designing a curriculum for Computer Science Teaching Assistants (TAs), as part of the Inclusive Computing Fellowship, was published in a news article by [SBU News](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/about-us/News/leveling-ta-training-builds-strong-foundation-and-diversity-awareness).
