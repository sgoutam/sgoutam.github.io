I am a PhD student in the CS department at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu), where I am a member of the Ethos Lab and am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Amir Rahmati](https://amir.rahmati.com). My research is broadly focused on security and privacy of cyber-physical systems, IoT ecosystems, and distributed networking systems. Before moving to New York, I was a Software Engineer working on a distributed shared memory infrastructure at [HPE Aruba Networks](https://www.arubanetworks.com/company/about-us/) in California.

I received my MS from North Carolina State University, where I was a graduate research student in [Wolfpack Security \& Privacy Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/), advised by [Prof. William Enck](https://enck.org) and [Prof. Brad Reaves](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/bgreaves/).
